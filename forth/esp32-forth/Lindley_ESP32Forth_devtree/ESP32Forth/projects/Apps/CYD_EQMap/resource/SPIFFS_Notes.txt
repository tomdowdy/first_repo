NOTES:

Preparing ESP32 for operation

The EQ program needs to have the map file ERP320.bmp
stored in the SPIFFS. To do this, first load and run the
ESP32 Arduino app called: 

ESP32_OTA_FILESYS.ino

In this app you can format the SPIFFS and copy
the map file to the SPIFFS.

Then upload ESP32forth

and then

load the CYD_EQMap program and run it.
